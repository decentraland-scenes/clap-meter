## Description
A meter that goes up based on the number of claps from players applauding in the scene. To view the scene, please visit [here](https://clap-meter.vercel.app/).

## Instructions
The scene checks whether you're in first person or third person view - for the best experience, you should switch to the third person view by pressing the <kbd>V</kbd> key. To move the needle on the meter just clap by pressing the number <kbd>5</kbd> key - keep pressing <kbd>5</kbd> to move it further to the right. Once you stop clapping, the needle will also stop moving and will even start moving towards the left again after a short cooldown period.
